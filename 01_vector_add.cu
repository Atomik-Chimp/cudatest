 *
 * Final Exercise: Accelerate Vector Addition Application
 * 
 * The following challenge will give you an opportunity to use everything that you 
 * have learned thus far in the lab. It involves accelerating a CPU-only vector addition 
 * program, which, while not the most sophisticated program, will give you an opportunity 
 * to focus on what you have learned about GPU-accelerating an application with CUDA. 
 * After completing this exercise, if you have time and interest, continue on to the 
 * Advanced Content section for some challenges that involve more complex codebases.
 *
 * 01-vector-add.cu contains a functioning CPU-only vector addition application. Accelerate 
 * its addVectorsInto function to run as a CUDA kernel on the GPU and to do its work in 
 * parallel. Consider the following that need to occur, and refer to the solution if you 
 * get stuck.
 *
 * Augment the addVectorsInto definition so that it is a CUDA kernel.
 * Choose and utilize a working execution configuration so that addVectorsInto 
 *  launches as a CUDA kernel.
 * Update memory allocations, and memory freeing to reflect that the 3 vectors a, b, 
 *  and result need to be accessed by host and device code.
 * Refactor the body of addVectorsInto: it will be launched inside of a single thread, 
 *  and only needs to do one thread's worth of work on the input vectors. Be certain the 
 *  thread will never try to access elements outside the range of the input vectors, and 
 *  take care to note whether or not the thread needs to do work on more than one element 
 *  of the input vectors.
 * Add error handling in locations where CUDA code might otherwise silently fail.
