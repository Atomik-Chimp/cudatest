/*
 * Exercise: Accelerate 2D Matrix Multiply Application
 * 
 * The file 01-matrix-multiply-2d.cu contains a host function matrixMulCPU which is fully functional.
 * Your task is to build out the matrixMulGPU CUDA kernel. The source code will execute the matrix 
 * multiplication with both functions, and compare their answers to verify the correctness of the 
 * CUDA kernel you will be writing. Use the following guidelines to support your work and refer 
 * to the solution if you get stuck:
 *
 * You will need to create an execution configuration whose arguments are both dim3 values with the 
 * x and y dimensions set to greater than 1. Inside the body of the kernel, you will need to establish 
 * the running thread's unique index within the grid per usual, but you should establish two indices 
 * for the thread: one for the x axis of the grid, and one for the y axis of the grid.
